# AI Assistant Rules & Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a **Run Goals** application with Strava integration that allows users to track fitness goals individually and in groups. The application focuses on distance, elevation, and summit counting across various activities.

### Memory

You can make use of the /.ai/memory folder to store **living knowledge** about how the project is structured and works. This should focus on:

- High-level architecture and patterns
- Non-obvious technical insights that aren't clear from reading the code
- Key relationships between components
- Important project context and domain knowledge

**Keep memory lightweight and focused on what future agents need to understand the project, not a record of what you did.** When you finish a task, update memory files only if there's genuinely useful architectural or domain knowledge to preserve. Avoid detailed implementation logs, change histories, or step-by-step processes.

Memory files have the format:

1. Description - short description of what knowledge is being stored
2. Content - concise, actionable knowledge about the project

### Plans

The /.ai/plans folder keeps track of the existing plans for a requested change. You may be asked to build up a plan, or work through a plan. A plan will be suffixed with \_complete once its done. Plan files should be prefixed with a number The structure of a plan is as follows:

1. Description - a short description of the changes we want to make.
2. Scope - some points on what is in and out of scope for this change.
3. Steps - a plan will be broken down into clear, concise steps. Each step will start with open brackets e.g. [ ] and it will be filled when upon completion [*].

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular (TypeScript) with SCSS styling
- **Backend**: Go with REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with Strava OAuth integration

### Key Features

- Individual and group goal tracking
- Strava activity synchronization
- Summit/peak tracking with geographical data
- Progress visualization and member contributions
- Real-time goal progress updates

### Key Services & Components

- **GroupService**: Handles all group-related operations and state management
- **StravaService**: Manages Strava API integration and activity synchronization
- **Groups Components**: Handle group creation, member management, and goal tracking
- **Progress Components**: Display goal progress with various visualization types

### Important Data Flow

1. User authenticates via Strava OAuth
2. Activities are synced from Strava API
3. Goals are created with specific types (distance, elevation, summits)
4. Member contributions are calculated based on activity data within goal date ranges
5. Progress is displayed in real-time using Angular signals

### Database Relationships

- Users can belong to multiple groups
- Groups can have multiple goals with different types and date ranges
- Activities are linked to users and contribute to goal progress
- Peaks/summits are tracked separately with geographical data

### API Patterns

- All API responses follow consistent DTO patterns
- Authentication required for most endpoints
- RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes
- Error responses include structured error messages
